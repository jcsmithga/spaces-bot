Hello,

Currently I have two Javascript files here, bot.js and server.js, bot.js being a Twitch chatbot used with tmi.js and is a functional "practice list" bot for speedrunning, mostly.
server.js is brand new and follows this tut up to a point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ASwlMcWik , and honestly I'm not 100% sure what I need.

The goal is to combine these files somehow, because the first one talks to IRC if I'm correct, and the 2nd one talks to Twtich's API.

Short term, I'd like to be able for someone to redeem a channel point redemption in my chat and the cost go up or go down based on what I decide to do. Long term I'd like to understand how to make Twitch API requests and use them for whatever I want.
Really, this is an educational venture for me.

These two files have credentials removed (hopefully) as well as their context of the directory they're in on my computer. You need all the requirements the files ask for as well as node js.
